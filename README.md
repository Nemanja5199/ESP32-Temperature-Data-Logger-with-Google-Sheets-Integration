#Writing Temperature Data to Google Sheets using ESP32
This project demonstrates how to utilize an ESP32 microcontroller to read temperature data from a sensor and send it to a Google Sheets spreadsheet for logging and visualization. This can be particularly useful for environmental monitoring, home automation, or any application where remote temperature monitoring is required.

Requirements
ESP32 microcontroller board
Temperature sensor (e.g., DS18B20, DHT11, DHT22)
Google account
Google Sheets API credentials
Arduino IDE
Setup
Hardware Setup:

Connect the temperature sensor to the ESP32 board according to its datasheet.
Ensure that the ESP32 is connected to the internet via Wi-Fi.
Google Sheets Setup:

Create a new Google Sheets document.
Enable the Google Sheets API and generate credentials (OAuth 2.0 client ID) following these instructions.
Note down the generated credentials (client ID, client secret, etc.).
Software Setup:

Install the necessary libraries in your Arduino IDE for the ESP32 and the temperature sensor.
Clone or download the code repository.
Usage
Configuration:

Open the Arduino sketch provided in this repository.
Enter your Wi-Fi credentials.
Configure the sensor pin and other settings according to your setup.
Add the Google Sheets API credentials to the sketch.
Upload Sketch:

Compile and upload the sketch to your ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE.
Monitoring:

Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to view temperature data being read from the sensor and sent to Google Sheets.
Data Visualization:

Access your Google Sheets document to view the logged temperature data.
Utilize Google Sheets features or integrate with other tools for data visualization and analysis.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, refer to the serial monitor output for debugging information.
Ensure that your ESP32 is connected to the internet and has proper access to the Google Sheets API.
